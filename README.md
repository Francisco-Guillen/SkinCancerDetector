# Skin Cancer Detection Web App

This repository contains the source code of a web application for skin cancer detection using machine learning. The application is capable of receiving images of skin lesions and classifying them into three categories: Basal Cell Carcinoma (Cancer), Melanoma (Cancer), and Nevus (Non-Cancerous).

## Features

- Image Upload: Users can upload images of skin lesions for analysis.
- Cancer Detection: The application uses a machine learning model based on MobileNetV2 architecture to predict the probability of each class for the uploaded image.
- Generation of Heatmaps (Grad-CAM): Heatmaps are generated to visualize the regions of the image that contribute most to the classification decision of the model.
